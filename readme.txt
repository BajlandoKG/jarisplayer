==================
Be Free!
==================

Searching for an flv player that could be used freely in all aspects and open source was 
a hard job. So I just decided to work on a basic player that had the most important 
features found in others players.

Thats the story of how Jaris was born.

==================
Features
==================

    * Keeps video Aspect Ratio
    * Fullscreen Support
    * Video Thumbnail
    * Volume Control
    * Seek Control
    * Time Display
    * Your own Logo

==================
License
==================

Jaris is licensed under GPL and LGPL, meaning that you could use it for commercial use. 
What we ask for is that any improvements made to the player should be taken over here so 
that any one could enjoy the new improvements or features also. In this way everyone could 
help to maintain an up to date tool that adapts to todays multimedia demands. 
Using sourceforge.net you could send a patch https://sourceforge.net/projects/jaris/.

Enjoy a totally free player ;-)
